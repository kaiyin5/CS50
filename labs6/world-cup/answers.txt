Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The case of 100 simulations is faster than the one of 10.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10,000 simulations as the result of top 4 remain unchanged in larger number simulations.
